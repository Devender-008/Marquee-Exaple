# Engaging Marquee Tags

This project demonstrates the use of the `<marquee>` tag in HTML along with CSS enhancements to create an engaging and visually appealing scrolling text effect. 

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles applied to the HTML elements.

## Features

- **Horizontal Marquee**: Displays Header scrolling from right to left.
- **Vertical Marquee**: Displays Body scrolling upwards.
- **Custom Marquee**: Uses CSS animations for a smooth scrolling effect.



## Customization

- **Changing Content**: You can easily change the content by editing the text inside the `<marquee>` tags and the `.marquee-content` div in `index.html`.
- **Styling Adjustments**: Modify the `style.css` file to change colors, font sizes, padding, margins, and other stylistic elements.
- **Animation Speed**: Adjust the `scrollamount` attribute in the `<marquee>` tags or the `animation` duration in the CSS for the custom marquee to change the scrolling speed.
